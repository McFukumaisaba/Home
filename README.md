## Requirement
- Vault (if you want to enable payment for placing homes)
- An Economy plugin supported by a vault like EssentialX

## Description
MultipleHomes is a versatile plugin for Minecraft that revolutionizes home management on your server. With its intuitive GUI interface, players can easily create and manage multiple homes with ease. The plugin seamlessly integrates with the economy system, allowing you to set prices for homes and implement dynamic pricing based on the number of homes owned.

## Customization
Customization is key with MultipleHomes.

With the ability to add a back button and define custom commands, you can enhance the gameplay experience for your players.

- `/home open <player>`: Opens the homes inventory for a targeted player (for console if you use DisableCommands).
